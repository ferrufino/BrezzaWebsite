<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h4>Gustavo Ferrufino built the TrailCast app for free to download. The app provides a basic version at no cost and is intended for use 'as is'. A subscription-based service, TrailCast Pro, is also available for users who wish to access premium features.</h4>

<h2>Notice</h2>
<p>This page is used to inform visitors about my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for those who choose to use TrailCast.</p>
<p>If you choose to use TrailCast, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving TrailCast. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>As of today, no user data is collected for the basic version of the app, nor is there any intention to collect it in the future -- other than for analytics of app performance to fix bugs. For users who subscribe to TrailCast Pro, limited data is collected solely for subscription management and payment processing through Apple subscriptions and RevenueCat. Your Strava access token and Trails are securely stored locally on your phone, and I do not have access to this data.</p>
