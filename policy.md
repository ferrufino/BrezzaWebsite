# Privacy Policy

#### Gustavo Ferrufino built the Brezza app for free to download. The app provides a basic version at no cost and is intended for use 'as is'.

## Notice

This page is used to inform visitors about my policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for those who choose to use Brezza.

If you choose to use Brezza, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving Brezza. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

As of today, no user data is collected, nor is there any intention to collect it in the future. Your Strava access token and Trails are securely stored locally on your phone, and I do not have access to this data.

The app uses third-party services to provide various features. Below are links to the privacy policies of these third-party service providers:

- [Firebase RemoteConfig](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config/parameters?template_type=client)
- [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/privacy/)
- [Apple WeatherKit](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/weather/#:~:text=To%20understand%20and%20improve%20the,to%20provide%20relevant%20weather%20forecasts.)

## General Agreement

By installing and using this app, you agree to the following terms:

"I" refers to the user of the app, and "Brezza" refers to all members involved with the app.

I understand and agree that participation in using the app carries the risk of personal or bodily injury (including death) and loss or damage to property. I willingly and knowingly accept these risks. I also understand and agree that "Brezza" does not and will not guarantee my safety during my use of the app.

With this understanding, I, individually and on behalf of my heirs, successors, assigns, and personal representatives, hereby release, relieve, indemnify, and forever discharge "Brezza," its trustees, and representatives (in their official and individual capacities) from any and all liability whatsoever for any personal or bodily injury (including death) and loss of or damage to property. This includes, but is not limited to, any claims, demands, actions, causes of action, judgments, damages, expenses, and costs, including attorney fees, which arise out of, result from, occur during, or are connected in any manner with my use of the app, any related or independent travel, or activities, irrespective of whether or not they are sponsored, supervised, or controlled by "Brezza."

## Agreement on the "Import from Strava" Feature

The "Import from Strava" feature in Brezza allows users to import Activities or Saved Routes from Strava. The imported data is limited to the selected routes you choose to import. All this data and access is stored locally on your phone. Brezza does not collect or store this data externally.

Brezza complies with Strava’s API usage policies, ensuring that all user data is securely handled and never shared externally. There is no intention of using data from Strava for AI-training.

## Log Data

In the event of an error within the app, Brezza may collect data and information (via third-party services) like Firebase Crashlytics. This Log Data does not include personally identifiable information but may include details such as your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the app's configuration at the time of use, the time and date of your use of Brezza, and other statistics.

## Children’s Privacy

Brezza does not address anyone under the age of 4. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 4. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided personal information, please contact me, and I will take necessary actions to remove such data.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are encouraged to review this page periodically for any changes. Changes will be posted on this page and are effective immediately upon posting.
